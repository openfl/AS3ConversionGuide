# User Interface Components

OpenFL does not have any drop-in replacements for the component classes contained in the **fl.controls** flash package.   
For interface components such as fl.controls.List , fl.controls.RadioButton , and so on, a Haxe UI library will have to be used.

A Haxe UI library will let you use your existing graphical assets while the library provides the programmed functionality of the interface component.
  
Listed below are some options for implementing user interface components:
